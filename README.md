# Hello-world
First time doing this shit
I'm working on becoming in IOS developer and its harder than I thought. I'm trying to get a higher paying job so that I can focus on other things I love to do, Like be the best fucking movie director on the motha fuckin Planet. Right now I am unable to focus my attention to that right now because all these other bills I have. So there for I must work to be the best damn IOS developer in the motha fuckin planet so I can work to my next dream.
